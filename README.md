# ConsultEase

A comprehensive system for enhanced student-faculty interaction, featuring RFID-based authentication, real-time faculty availability, and streamlined consultation requests.

## Components

### Central System (Raspberry Pi)
- PyQt5 user interface for student interaction
- RFID-based authentication
- Real-time faculty availability display
- Consultation request management with improved UI
- Secure admin interface with automatic login account management
- Touch-optimized UI with on-screen keyboard support (squeekboard preferred)
- Smooth UI transitions and animations
- Integrated admin account creation and repair
- Real-time system monitoring and health checks
- Comprehensive audit logging for security compliance

### Faculty Desk Unit (ESP32)
- 2.4" TFT Display for consultation requests
- BLE-based presence detection (configurable always-available mode)
- MQTT communication with Central System
- Real-time status updates
- Improved reliability and error handling

## Requirements

### Central System
- Raspberry Pi 4 (Bookworm 64-bit)
- 10.1-inch touchscreen (1024x600 resolution)
- USB RFID IC Reader
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL database

### Faculty Desk Unit
- ESP32 microcontroller
- 2.4-inch TFT SPI Screen (ST7789)
- Arduino IDE 2.0+

## Installation

### Central System

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database:
```bash
# Create database and user
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE consultease;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER piuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE consultease TO piuser;"
```

3. Install touchscreen utilities (for Raspberry Pi):
```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/keyboard_setup.sh
sudo ./scripts/keyboard_setup.sh
```

Note: The system now uses a unified keyboard setup script that supports both squeekboard and onboard, with automatic fallback. Squeekboard is preferred for mobile-friendly environments, while onboard is used as a fallback. You can also install squeekboard directly:

```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/install_squeekboard.sh
./scripts/install_squeekboard.sh
```

4. Calibrate the touchscreen (if needed):
```bash
sudo chmod +x scripts/calibrate_touch.sh
sudo ./scripts/calibrate_touch.sh
```

5. Enable fullscreen mode (for deployment):
```bash
python scripts/enable_fullscreen.py
```

6. Run the application:
```bash
python central_system/main.py
```

## Admin Access

ConsultEase includes integrated admin account management that automatically ensures a working admin account is always available.

### Default Admin Credentials

The system automatically creates and maintains a default admin account:

```
Username: admin
Password: TempPass123!
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- ⚠️ This is a **temporary password** that MUST be changed on first login
- 🔒 The system enforces **strong password requirements** for new passwords
- 📝 All admin actions are **logged for audit purposes**
- 🔧 Admin account issues are **automatically repaired** during system startup

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

1. **Start the application** - The system will automatically verify/create the admin account
2. **Touch the screen** to activate the interface
3. **Click "Admin Login"** button
4. **Enter credentials**: `admin` / `TempPass123!`
5. **Change password** when prompted (required for security)
6. **Access full admin functionality**

### Admin Account Features

- ✅ **Automatic Creation**: Admin account is created automatically if it doesn't exist
- ✅ **Self-Repair**: System fixes broken admin accounts during startup
- ✅ **Security Enforcement**: Forced password changes and strong password requirements
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: All admin operations are logged for audit trails
- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: No manual setup required - works out of the box

The system startup logs will show the admin account status and provide login instructions.

### Faculty Desk Unit

1. Install the Arduino IDE and required libraries:
   - TFT_eSPI
   - NimBLE-Arduino
   - PubSubClient
   - ArduinoJson

2. Configure TFT_eSPI for your display

3. Update the configuration in `faculty_desk_unit/config.h`:
   - Set the faculty ID and name
   - Configure WiFi credentials
   - Set MQTT broker IP address
   - Configure BLE settings (including always-on option)

4. Upload the sketch to your ESP32

5. Test the faculty desk unit using the unified test utility:
   ```bash
   # Test MQTT communication with faculty desk unit
   python scripts/test_utility.py mqtt-test --broker 192.168.1.100

   # Send a test message to faculty desk unit
   python scripts/test_utility.py faculty-desk --faculty-id 3 --message "Test message"

   # Simulate a BLE beacon for faculty presence detection
   python scripts/test_utility.py ble-beacon --faculty-id 2

   # Monitor all MQTT messages on the broker
   python scripts/test_utility.py monitor --broker 192.168.1.100
   ```

## Touchscreen Features

ConsultEase includes several features to enhance usability on touchscreen devices:

- **Auto-popup keyboard**: Virtual keyboard (squeekboard or onboard) appears automatically when text fields receive focus
- **Fullscreen mode**: Optimized for touchscreen deployment with full screen utilization
- **Touch calibration**: Tools to ensure accurate touch input recognition
- **Touch-friendly UI**: Larger buttons and input elements optimized for touch interaction
- **Smooth transitions**: Enhanced UI transitions between screens for better user experience
- **Improved consultation panel**: Better readability and user feedback in the consultation interface

See the user manual, deployment guide, and keyboard setup guide in the `docs/` directory for detailed instructions on touchscreen setup and optimization.

## RFID Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the RFID scanner, the following tools can help:

### Automated RFID Fix (Raspberry Pi)

Run the following command to automatically detect and configure your RFID reader:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/fix_rfid.sh
```

This script will:
1. Detect connected USB devices
2. List potential RFID readers
3. Test the selected device
4. Configure proper permissions
5. Create udev rules for persistent configuration

### Manual RFID Debugging

For more granular control, use the debug_rfid.py tool:

```bash
# List all input devices and identify potential RFID readers
python scripts/debug_rfid.py list

# Monitor a specific input device to see raw events
python scripts/debug_rfid.py monitor <device_number>

# Test RFID reading functionality with a specific device
python scripts/debug_rfid.py test <device_number>
```

### Common RFID Issues

1. **Permission denied errors**: Run `sudo chmod -R a+r /dev/input/` to ensure proper permissions
2. **Device not detected**: Ensure it's properly connected and check `lsusb` output
3. **Wrong device selected**: Use the debug tool to identify the correct device
4. **Thread-related crashes**: The latest update includes thread-safe implementations to prevent crashes

For the target RFID reader with VID:ffff PID:0035, the system should auto-detect it during startup.
